# global picture
- the full company at bird's eye view
- all the departments and their relations
- who is who in the management and how they relate to each other
- company strategy and priorities

# first focused information gathering
- current projects and commitments
- priorities
- dependencies, blockages, bottlenecks and challenges
- teams and people
- pain and frustration points - work out what needs changing together with the people

# stuff to understand
- estimates like "one man year"
- the Theory of Constraints (E. M. Goldratt)
- 80/20 rule

# ideas
- preventive maintenance - analysis following any incident
- identify themes out of specific issues
- away from firefighting into a stable flow - be reliable but also adaptable
- WIP is the silent killer (see: "no inventory" in the Toyota Production System)
- "Your job as vp of it Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure it service."
- Three Ways
    - create a fast flow
    - shorten and amplify feedback loops
    - create a culture fostering experimentation, learning from failures
