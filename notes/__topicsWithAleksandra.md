Notes from Natalya V.

Felix is going to be replaced
	he has the knowledge to support the configurators
	in case configurator requests keep coming they should be redirected to the CDS team
	ideally he should be replaced by some simcorp internal or someone who is shadowed by a simcorp internal
	
we had apparently a bi-weekly review that was cancelled, between SN and their stakeholders
	we are expected to reiterate again, maybe on a monthly basis
