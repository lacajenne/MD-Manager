Notes from Natalya V.

Felix is going to be replaced
	ideally he should be replaced by some simcorp internal or someone who is shadowed by a simcorp internal
	he has the knowledge to support the configurators
	in case configurator requests keep coming, we should find a way to systematically redirect them to the CDS team
	
we had apparently a bi-weekly review that was cancelled, between SN and their stakeholders
	we are expected to reiterate again, maybe on a monthly basis
