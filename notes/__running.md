Varun was hired in VS SC1 as Test Architect. No one knows what he is expected to do. 
He was tasked to create a testing strategy. But there was a draft from the Swiss Knives that was approved by Paul.
Whatever happend with Varun - he has not the knowledge [Driss] - and SNs are already working on it.
We have a conflict. Discuss with Aleksandra. He came and did not find anything to do because there was already a framework 
    - he volunteered for a testing strategy.
There was apparently an issue in communication.
He should be onboarded with the team, brought to the team and let him do what he wants under the umbrella of SN.
Natalia and Driss wanted to talk with Ryan but apparently were not allowed.
Varun seems to have the wrong compentences and aspirations.

Continuing onboarding and testing strategy discussions
Following the topic with Driss and Florian, we have planned a meeting, going to figure out if other people need to be involved

unplanned work - reserving buffers for unplanned work
customer feedback - the cycle does not hand when we hand stuff over - the feedback is a new starting point

Maybe we can define a timeline for these upgrades together. My understanding is that we want

to announce them at least a few days in advance
figure out how long they will take and whether we expect down time

A lot of topics are covered by cVation people in SN.
Swiss Knives were supposed to be temporary but have become a long term thing.
Workload keeps increasing - SNs are working to empower people - but even with this approach, SN need to grow.
The amount of stuff to be tested is also rapidly increasing and might explode suddenly.
