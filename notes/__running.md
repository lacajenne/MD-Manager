Question for Driss.
Hi! I am starting to build a picture in my head about the work of the Swiss Knives. I’d like to get a sense of where the Swiss Knives team stands at the moment: are you already in a normal operational rhythm, or are you still dealing with a higher share of urgent or temporary tasks while moving toward that steady‑state mode?

Salary Review 2026 - Tobias Sheppard

- pay outcomes feel deeply personal to employees - can feel equally challenging for managers

- there are a lot of sources of pressure: fainness, budget, performance data, morale, expectations... 
    and the EU Pay Transparency requirements

- annual salary review is a check point to validate employee compensation, considering performance along with positioning
    within the pay range and against peers

- approach - data driven
- fairness principle - considering location, performance and position in the range (compa-ratio)
- communication
- practicalities 

Learn about Compa Ratio - actual salary / mid range point

High level principles
market alignment - we benchmark with the technology sector but also consider financial services for some roles
competitive positioning - total cash compensation is centered around market median to insure internal equity 
pay fo performance

Chat with Driss.
SimCorp One going into Value Streams.
There are people going to do front office configuration - new people involved in the whole workflow.
Joining back and middle office in value streams - front office probably are not that mature
Ryan started hiring people without being aware - or ignoring - what was aready happening.
He was looking to hire people for front office when SNs are already covering the process E2E.
He hired Varun - but it was not a good fit. A lot of confusion, a lot of time was spent onboarding him. 
There was a strict hiring process and this hiring jumped over it completely - Varun does not have any of the mandatory knowledge.
He is creating chaos and noise right and left inviting a lot of people that are not concerned - an agent of entropy.
We need to stop this noise from the outside. 
If he accepts to fully work as a Swiss Knife, the team is ready to accept him.

Chat with Dmytro Pavlenko. 10 years experience, with SimCorp since November. Works in Warsaw.
Works in test automation mostly. Seems as skilled and confident as all others.
Sees cVation as Site Reliability Engineers mostly.
He finds the stress levels acceptable, the environment friendly.
They are building a network of contacts and escalation paths appear to exist.
I told him about my approach - that I will observe, that I know that the team is pretty independent already.
I do not wish to change things in a top-down approach. I want to get there together with them, sharing vision and strategy
from the company. The ceremonies we are going to implement are to be discussed within the team, and we want to reach a pragmatic agreement
on whatever workd best.

Varun was hired in VS SC1 as Test Architect. No one knows what he is expected to do. 
He was tasked to create a testing strategy. But there was a draft from the Swiss Knives that was approved by Paul.
Whatever happend with Varun - he has not the knowledge [Driss] - and SNs are already working on it.
We have a conflict. Discuss with Aleksandra. He came and did not find anything to do because there was already a framework 
    - he volunteered for a testing strategy.
There was apparently an issue in communication.
He should be onboarded with the team, brought to the team and let him do what he wants under the umbrella of SN.
Natalia and Driss wanted to talk with Ryan but apparently were not allowed.
Varun seems to have the wrong compentences and aspirations.

[09:30]
Continuing onboarding and testing strategy discussions
Following the topic with Driss and Florian, we have planned a meeting, going to figure out if other people need to be involved

[09:00]
unplanned work - reserving buffers for unplanned work
customer feedback - the cycle does not hand when we hand stuff over - the feedback is a new starting point

Maybe we can define a timeline for these upgrades together. My understanding is that we want

to announce them at least a few days in advance
figure out how long they will take and whether we expect down time


[13:30]
A lot of topics are covered by cVation people in SN.
Swiss Knives were supposed to be temporary but have become a long term thing.
Workload keeps increasing - SNs are working to empower people - but even with this approach, SN need to grow.
The amount of stuff to be tested is also rapidly increasing and might explode suddenly.

wave 1 - the start - 1 SN to 2 configurators
wave 2 - onboarding of value teams
wave 3 - Standard Platform - 1 SN to 10 configurators
