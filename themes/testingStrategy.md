Discussion with Artur Cybruch, 260220

-- this is all to be confirmed - not being affirmed - we are getting attention to assess a risk that impacts the testing strategy
-- we are talking about customer specific testing
-- many teams are involved with complex handovers and possibly loss of context and other inefficiences
-- it seems there is overall too much complexity in the way the work is managed across teams
-- it seems that the testing (SIT, UAT, DR) are happening LATE (shortly before go-live) and seem to be an afterthought
-- relevent customers are INTECH and Lindsell Train (SC1, therefore more relevant)
-- affected teams are Value Streams Teams responding to Thomas Olson and Ryan Glass 
-- source of this information is partially Monday.com that is shared with the customer and stakeholders to show planning 
-- testing strategy is certainly relevant here
