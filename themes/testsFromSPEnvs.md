[260218 ]Aleksandra 

hello - I am following up on our conversation yesterday related to enablement of PD areas to use/reuse their tests that they used to run in SP environments. Here are ambassador names (we teach them, they teach others - and - they're the points of contact for further follow ups on the topic):
for Accounting: Robert Widing (RWD)
for Investments: Adrian Lachowicz (ADLA)
for Risk (currently blocked to move to SC1) : Jean Carot (JEC)    NOTE from Aleks: to be confirmed - he's Product Owner, I expected someone more technical - but we can ask him to find us a test ambassador in area he covers
