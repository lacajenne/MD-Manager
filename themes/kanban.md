current state on 12/02/2026

- there is no backlog management and no real prioritization - a lot of decisions are taken in real time

- there are no limits to WIP - only the limit of 1 item per person at a time

- the workload is high - there are high expectations on the support work

- specialization is necessary because the areas to know are vast and constantly increasing - RISK of creating silos
    - the state of the whole team sharing the whole knowledge is only approached very, very slowly
    - people are picking items from their comfort zone for understandable reason 
        - there is will from some in the team to break this pattern

- the team can organize itself also around absences but I sense a vulnerability
    - there are areas of overlap in knowledge among people

- the team is supposed to develop solutions and processes but no tools internally 
    - the dependence on others can be frustrating and can be a serious limit to the reusability of solutions
        - this in turn is a limit to the scalability of the process

- the team is doing both testing and support - this can be an issue 

- the devops board does not reflect reality in a reliable way
    - the choice of board columns is probably not optimal as side effect of this

- the idea of pairing up on tasks to support the sharing of knowledge is accepted but is faced with practical difficulties - we are not there yet




Extra notes:
- Aleksandra and I need to figure out if the Swiss Knives is on a positive trajectory
- the cVation variable is part of what we need to figure out
