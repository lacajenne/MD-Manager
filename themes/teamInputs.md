Something what I would really like to exist there is some sort of information channel(s) that would allow me to track changes that are affecting SRODEV for ex.
 
If such thing exists, I would like to learn how to use it 
 
Often times we have to deal with unexpected modifications on the environment that forces us to find the reason the tests are failing + find the team and a contact person + reach out and understand what has changed, is that going to be a part of the standard or is that a temporary inconvenience.
 
I'd love enhancements in this area. But knowing there's a dozens of teams working on individual parts of the SCD, it could be challenging to come up with some solution.
