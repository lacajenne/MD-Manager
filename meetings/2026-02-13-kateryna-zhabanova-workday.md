Discuss with Aleksandra: promotion of Driss from IC6 to IC7 
    budget is limited - split increase between performance and promotion

Dmytro Pavlenko - works for Emagine - review his status at the end of May 
    his current contract is a 2 years contract valid until 30th June 2027   
    his contract should be reviewed in June - this means adjusting his rate
        his contract needs to be extended in Workday - Workday must match the actual contract

Mykola is being moved to Vienna
    ping Aleksandra if he is not in Workday by Tuesday

Stefan - nothing for now

Chhitiz - parental leave - when? - set it up in Workday - talk to Bettina - C. should be able to enter it himself into Workday

Stefan and Chhitiz are not working in the SimCorp office because it was agreed that they work at cVation

To get support on Workday, go to the Help Center and then "Ask People Service"
    use the help desk and create tickets

Need to check the status of the cVation contracts - there might be new ones - need to get them - they will require updating in Workday
    - discuss with Aleksandra






Kateryna - enter for Driss in Workday - assessment under Real Journey - values must be in by today - submission not mandatory, values are

    impact
    culture
    growth

        these fields are the reason behind the promotion of Driss 

    We need to make sure this information was provided by Kateryna
        and that it is sufficient to justify a promotion 

need to be able to show that there was a discussion with the previous manager - on the performance of Driss
