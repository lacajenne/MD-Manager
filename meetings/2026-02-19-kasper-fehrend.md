He is a very competent, expert and complete engineer, architecture level.
High focus and experience on testing. Long good career. 
He claims that SK had issues with other teams for being brutally honest.
Recommends that I focus on the testing.
Thinks cVation is going to stay - he seems to be suggesting splitting the job.
