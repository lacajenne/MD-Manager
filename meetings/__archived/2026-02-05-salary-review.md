Meeting notes:

Overview of Salary Review Process: 
Tobias led the meeting by outlining the objectives and structure of the 2026 Salary Review at SimCorp, emphasizing a data-driven, fair, and transparent approach, and highlighting the support available to managers throughout the process.
	Purpose and Structure: Tobias explained that the salary review is an annual process to validate employee compensation against the market and peers, and to support promotions, with a focus on fairness, performance, and internal equity.
	Manager Responsibilities: Managers are expected to apply reward principles consistently, communicate decisions transparently, and consider factors such as employee location, performance, and position within the pay range.
	Support and Guidance: Tobias assured managers that they are not alone in the process, with clear guidance, resources on Workday, and support from People Business Partners available.
Employee Perspectives on Compensation: 
Tobias presented insights from the Peakon employee engagement survey, highlighting key themes employees raise about compensation, such as career progression, pay equity, and market competitiveness, and discussed how these perceptions inform the review process.
	Survey Insights: Tobias summarized the most common employee concerns from Peakon survey comments, including career progression clarity, internal pay equity, pensions, inflation, benefit quality, workload recognition, cross-location fairness, and market competitiveness.
	Reward Engagement Trends: Analysis of reward engagement scores showed a general positive trend over time, with noticeable improvements around the annual compensation process, suggesting effective manager communication and process navigation.
	Manager Communication: Managers are encouraged to build a narrative around compensation decisions, linking pay to career development and articulating the broader employee value proposition beyond salary.
Merit Budgets and Inflation Considerations: 
Tobias detailed how merit budgets are determined at SimCorp, explaining the relationship between merit increases, inflation, and market data, and clarified that merit increases are not directly tied to inflation but are based on market competitiveness and cost of labor.
	Country-Specific Budgets: Tobias reviewed how merit budgets vary by country, citing examples such as Argentina, India, Switzerland, and Ukraine, and explained the rationale behind these differences, including extraordinary cases where inflation is pre-empted.
	Budget Determination Process: Merit budgets are approved annually by the Executive Committee based on financial projections and market data, with each country receiving its own allocation.
	Inflation vs. Market Data: SimCorp does not link merit increases directly to inflation but instead targets market median salaries, considering broader economic and industry factors, and bases increases on the cost of labor.
Pay Principles and Compa Ratio Explanation: 
Tobias clarified key compensation terminology, including base salary, total cash compensation, and compa ratio, and described SimCorp’s approach to benchmarking, pay for performance, and guiding employees through pay ranges.
	Compensation Components: Definitions were provided for base salary, total guaranteed cash, total cash compensation, and total rewards, with emphasis on how these are used in different regions.
	Compa Ratio Calculation: Tobias explained how compa ratio is calculated as the employee’s salary divided by the midpoint of the range, and how this metric is used to assess positioning within the pay range.
	Market Benchmarking: SimCorp benchmarks salaries primarily against the technology sector, targeting the market median for total cash compensation, and uses pay ranges to allow flexibility in positioning.
	Pay for Performance: The company’s philosophy is to reward performance and skill development, enabling employees to progress through the pay range as they advance in their roles.
Bias Awareness and Data-Driven Decision Making: 
Tobias emphasized the importance of recognizing and mitigating bias in merit decisions, encouraging managers to use objective data, review legacy anomalies, and ensure fair outcomes, especially in light of new legal requirements.
	Types of Bias: Common biases such as recency bias, halo/horns effect, and affinity bias were discussed, with guidance on how to avoid them in performance and pay decisions.
	Decision-Making Process: Managers are instructed to anchor decisions in objective performance data, review and justify pay anomalies, differentiate based on documented impact, and ensure any pay gaps are explainable.
	Legal Context: With increasing legal requirements, particularly around gender pay equity, making defensible, data-driven decisions is now essential to avoid compliance risks.
EU Pay Transparency Directive and Pay Equity Analysis: 
Joanna explained the upcoming EU Pay Transparency Directive, detailing new employee rights, disclosure requirements, and SimCorp’s approach to global pay and gender equity analysis, including how outliers will be flagged and addressed.
	Directive Requirements: From June 2026, employees in the EU can request information on average pay for comparable roles and the rationale behind pay decisions, with pay principles and ranges to be shared globally.
	Gender Pay Gap Reporting: Starting in 2027, SimCorp will report gender pay gaps in select countries, analyzing both overall and group-specific gaps, and must remediate unexplained gaps above 5%.
	Pay Equity Analysis Methods: SimCorp uses raw pay gap, equal pay analysis for smaller countries, and regression-based pay equity analysis for larger countries, focusing on identifying and reviewing outliers rather than enforcing artificial equalization.
	Manager Involvement: Managers may be asked to review or justify proposed increases for flagged outliers, with the goal of ensuring defensible and transparent pay decisions.
	Promotion and Representation Targets: SimCorp monitors promotion rates to ensure fair progression opportunities, aiming for female promotion rates in line with workforce representation, without setting quotas.
Workday Process and Timeline Updates: 
Tobias outlined the 2026 salary review timeline, described changes to the Workday process—including a single pool for merit and promotions—and provided guidance on navigating the system and accessing support.
	Process Timeline: The salary review process opens on February 13th, runs until March 6th, with analysis and approvals in March, and increases communicated to employees from April 1st.
	Workday Changes: For 2026, there is a single pool for merit and promotions, no pre-filled merit awards, and changes in how terminations and compensation changes affect the process.
	Manager Guidance: Managers are directed to Workday for help and guides, and are encouraged to contact their People Business Partner for support with any issues.
Q&A: Addressing Pay Equity, Budgets, and Manager Concerns: 
During the Q&A, Maria Mar, Pia, Irfan, Ian, Robert, Damian, and others raised questions about peer pay equity, budget constraints for addressing pay gaps, the impact of promotions on merit pools, and how to avoid creating future inequities, with Tobias and Joanna providing clarifications.
	Peer Pay Equity Over Time: Maria Mar asked how SimCorp ensures that employees hired at different times but reaching the same level are paid equitably; Tobias explained that while the merit matrix and principles aim to address this, perfect alignment is challenging due to budget constraints and market differences.
	Budget for Pay Gap Outliers: Irfan and Ian inquired about budgets for addressing pay gap outliers; Joanna clarified that there is no separate budget, and the merit budget should suffice for most cases, with only a small percentage of employees typically flagged as outliers.
	Promotion Impact on Merit Pools: Ian raised concerns that promotions could consume most of the merit pool, limiting the ability to address pay gaps; Tobias responded that planning with People Business Partners and, if necessary, multi-year approaches can help manage these challenges.
	Explaining Pay Gaps: Robert asked what constitutes an explainable pay gap; Joanna advised that managers should be able to justify differences within their teams, such as differences in starting salaries, but over time, gaps should be addressed through the merit process.
	Preventing Future Inequities: Damian asked how to avoid creating new pay gaps when hiring; Tobias emphasized the importance of managers being conscious of pay equity when making offers, with oversight from the compensation team to flag potential issues.
