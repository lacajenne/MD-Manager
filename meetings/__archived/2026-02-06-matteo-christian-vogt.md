Cockpit is the platform to manage and configure environments.
Kobold is the tool to deploy environments and create access packages for them.
SPPD is the cloud standardization tenant. Each customer has its own tenant.

Environments SN work on: SRODEV, SC1TEST, SC1GOLD

At this point most management of the infrastructure for SC1 standard environments itself is being taken care of by Maciej Chojka and POE team. We help coordinate downtime and act as first level of support when issues/errors occur. 
 
Much of the time the issues are easy to resolve (restart a service, check logs for access etc.).
Larger tasks (upgrades of SCD, INS file changes, change of Oracle host) are covered by POE team and coordinated by us.
Finally if there are crucial errors (VDI inaccessible, security breaches, deleted infrastructure) then we do the initial investigation and create a bug for resolution by platform.
 
I hope this gives some clarity on our role in keeping environments in working order.
