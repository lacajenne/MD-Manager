Varun joined SimCorp two months ago, and was working in banks before.
Manual and automated E2E testing. He was onboarded into many things.
Involved in the definition of a testing strategy for value streams.
Worked with AWS before but not in the Azure cloud. Moving to Azure now. 

Are we not separating tests in levels and types? Hard to believe. 
He proposes a division of types of test by environment: SC1DEV for Unit, SC1TEST for system, integration, E2E...
    extending into the client environments

It seems there is a communication/interaction problem. 
Is Varun creating confusion or is he not fitting in an organization that has communication problems?
Swiss Knives are deeply connected - is this only an advantage or also a limitation? 
Varun seems to know the testing theory. He clearly did his homework. But behind this? 



Would like to understand with Driss what happened exactly with Varun, his onboarding and his integration with the team.
Clarify what the view of the team is on testing pyramid, assignment of tests by category to the environments and so on.
Where is the integration problem coming from? Are SKs somehow refusing his input?
How can it be that he was given training but they could not sit together and talk of a strategy?
It seems to me that Varun identified a lack of testing strategy but somehow did not manage to proceed to the natural step
of trying to define one with the team. Was the team rejecting it? Was he expecting to dictate it?
Maybe it could make sense to have him support SKs from Front Office instead?
Align with their way of working without being in the team.
