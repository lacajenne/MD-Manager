Onboarding. With Aleksandra and Mathias Hecht Alexander. 

It takes a LONG time to onboard clients because of the existing silos.
Smaller organizations are not willing to accept the high costs involved. 

SimCorp is not even close to being able to deliver something that works out of the box.

Silos have been broken at least on paper. 

Value Streams are SimCorp One and Business Services, the latter having most focus on right now.
It contains Managed Business Services - whose ambition is to offer "we are going to do everything for you".
We want to standardize the basis we give to all customers.

Customers follow the operations via regular reports. SimCorp takes care of the nitty-gritty details.  
This is the goal of SimCorp One - a full service.

SimCorp One is steadily growing. The SimCorp One is the place for all standard configurations, from many product areas.
There are many configuration stakeholders working with SimCorp One, and they are NOT on the same page.
- IOS are the ones most on board.
- Front Office is an immature area and they have most customizations. The product behind is immature.
- Product Areas are also involved but were used to just passing on their configurations to someone else. 
They accept the SimCorp One but would like to continue with the same old approach. There is conflict here.
They demand to have the vNext version and so on. 
It has to become clear to everyone that people are not delivering configurations in a vacuum - they get to actual client
environments, and in much shorter times as before. The release cycle time is being reduced as much as possible.
Changes have an effect much earlier. The whole perspective needs to change. And the quality of the configurations.
We cannot rely on someone intervening and making things work at some point. 
People are used to the silos and the associated way of working. 
- Regulatory service - they want to join SimCorp One but have problems with legacy clients.
- DMS Value Team - issues with data standardization. This includes test data. That needs to be managed and mantained. 

Swiss Knives are very effective because of their experience in the Release Office, they have a deep understanding and knowledge of
what needs to be done when, wherem by whom. They have the right communication channels.

Who is working with the SNs
- CDS - Configuration Deployment Service - CDMS 2.0 (XMGR & PS scripts) - high bus factor - Devid 
- AMS (Cloud Support, Platform Operation Excellence) - they know very well how to keep an SCD environment alive
- Platform - a difficult collaboration - they struggle to prioritize - remaining political battles are to be expected here
    - XMGR, INS File Management (license files) 
- Project Unicorn - the most pressured place in SimCorp - constantly on fire - they are not able to put it out - Seven Samurai team 
    - very difficult to get stuff done from them
