# [2026-01-26] Swiss Knives - cVation scaling discussion

# People
- Aleksandra Jovanovic
- Tina Wegmüller
- me

# Essential points
- cVation is a consulting company involved in Swiss Knives
- they will probably leave in the near future
- get in touch with Driss Biya
- read and review the existing documentation - this needs to be turned into something internal that we own, not an external documentation anymore


# NOTES
- to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOdTKpYUOAQ
- prioritize know-how-transfer
- ask what will break down if cVation leaves TOMORROW
- learn, document, spread the knowledge
- internal people to shadow consultants

# Questions
- how much is already documented? do we have a platform ready for it?
- [yes] can we have a gradual transition?
