Meeting notes:
Alignment and Transition of Testing Frameworks: 
Giuseppe, Nikola, and Tomek discussed the need for alignment and transition of automated tests from the previous framework to the new Simcorp 1 framework, highlighting similarities with other teams and the importance of prioritizing this work within the Swiss knives team.
	Current Testing Frameworks: Nikola explained that the team previously used a spec flow test framework driven by batch job groups, which encapsulated end-to-end processes from creating static data to transaction configuration and data comparison. The new Simcorp 1 framework requires a shift in approach, especially for front office components that need API testing, which was not supported before.
	Transition Challenges: Giuseppe and Nikola discussed the challenge of moving existing tests to the Simcorp 1 framework, noting that the process is similar to what Roger Krishna Swam's team is experiencing. The responsibility for implementing tests in the new framework is not yet defined, and the team is used to building and maintaining tests along with configuration and deployment.
	Framework Technical Details: Giuseppe described his understanding of the new C#-based framework, where transactions are assembled using C# methods and batch jobs are managed within a common pattern. Nikola confirmed this approach and added that most support for batch job group-driven testing is implemented, with special cases driving further completion.
	Stakeholder Alignment: Nikola emphasized that the team's needs are aligned with those of Roger and Robert, and that automated tests are crucial for oversight in the new, more user-friendly framework, which lacks the governance of the previous pull request-based system.
Test Execution and Environment Management: 
Nikola and Giuseppe addressed the complexities of executing automated tests in the new environment, including the lack of pipelines, potential impact on test environments, and the need for decisions regarding environment setup and test execution strategies.
	Pipeline and Environment Limitations: Nikola explained that the team currently cannot run tests due to the absence of pipelines and must decide which environments to use for running hundreds of tests, as frequent execution could slow down or impact the environment.
	Environment Impact Mitigation: Nikola shared that in the previous setup, the team used a dedicated test environment and a copy of the test suite to avoid blocking the main test environment, suggesting similar strategies may be needed for Simcorp 1.
	Short-Lived Environments: Giuseppe raised the issue of the lack of short-lived environments in Simcorp 1 and questioned how tests could be run without limiting each other, indicating this is a key consideration in the ongoing testing strategy.
	Testing Strategy Development: Giuseppe stated that the team is actively working on a testing strategy to address these challenges, with more information and decisions expected soon.
Governance and Oversight in the New Framework: 
Nikola highlighted concerns about the lack of governance in the new user-friendly framework, noting that frequent contributions and changes by consultants make it difficult to maintain standards without robust automated testing.
	Governance Challenges: Nikola described how the previous framework required pull requests and owner approvals, ensuring stability, while the new framework allows anyone to contribute and release packages, resulting in little oversight and daily unexpected changes.
	Importance of Automated Tests: Nikola stressed that automated tests are essential for verifying package integrity in the absence of strict governance, as changes can be made by anyone and there is no guarantee of stability without tests.
	Standard Ownership Issues: Nikola noted that maintaining ownership of standards is nearly impossible when many consultants can change them daily, and automated tests are the only way to ensure changes do not break functionality.
	Need for Compromise: Giuseppe acknowledged the need to find a compromise between user-friendliness and operability, agreeing that automated tests are a key part of making the framework manageable.
Recommendations and Next Steps: 
Nikola recommended that Giuseppe consult with Grzegorz Machak and the Sky team for insights on test environment management, and the group discussed the potential for a workshop with framework architects to clarify future directions.
	Consulting Experienced Teams: Nikola suggested Giuseppe speak with Grzegorz Machak and the Sky team, who previously solved similar problems on the thunder platform, to gain practical advice on test environment and pipeline management.
	Workshop Proposal: Giuseppe proposed organizing a short workshop with framework architects, such as Race, to align on future plans and clarify the vision for the testing framework, with Nikola agreeing that this would be beneficial if significant changes are planned.
Follow-up tasks:
Test Prioritization and Backlog Alignment: 
Discuss with the Swiss knives team to clarify priorities and determine how test-related work should be prioritized and flow into their backlog. (Giuseppe)
Test Implementation Responsibility: 
Clarify and agree on who will be responsible for implementing tests in the Simcorp 1 framework (Swiss knives team or stakeholders). (Giuseppe, Nikola)
Testing Strategy Development: 
Continue developing the overall testing strategy, including addressing test execution and environment limitations in Simcorp 1. (Giuseppe)
Knowledge Sharing with Skyteam: 
Reach out to Grzegorz Machak and the Skyteam to discuss their experience and solutions regarding similar testing framework challenges. (Giuseppe)
Testing Framework Governance and Vision: 
Arrange a follow-up discussion or workshop with the architect(s) (e.g., Race) to understand the future vision and governance for the testing framework. (Giuseppe)
