Kanban has different ceremonies than Scrum. Replenishment is one of them.
Refinement, Planning, Replenishment are more concepts than specific ceremonies - actual ceremonies can be a blend of them.
There are no sprints, but different types of cadences.
Policies are rules that the team chooses to follow in their work.
