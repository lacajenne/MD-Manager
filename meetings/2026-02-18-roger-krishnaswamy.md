Meeting notes:
Migration of Automated Testing Frameworks to Simcorp One: 

Giuseppe and Roger V. discussed the challenges and strategies for migrating automated test suites from the global standards framework to Simcorp One, highlighting the loss of existing automation and the need for manual execution as an interim step.
	Loss of Automation in Migration: Roger V. explained that the migration to Simcorp One resulted in the loss of the previously established automated testing framework, which included over 400 automated tests and a suite of merge gates and pull requests managed via GitHub.
	Manual Execution as Interim Solution: Giuseppe suggested that, due to the incompatibility of the old automation with Simcorp One, manual execution of tests may be necessary initially to establish a working definition before re-automating the scenarios.
	Technical Details of Previous Framework: Roger V. described the previous framework as using spec flow and batch job mechanisms, with installation-agnostic test data and automated assertions comparing expected and actual results, particularly for accounting-related tests.
	Impracticality of Rebuilding from Scratch: Roger V. emphasized that rebuilding the lost automation from scratch is not feasible due to the significant time and effort invested over the years.
Prioritization and Management of Test Suites: 
Giuseppe and Roger V. discussed the prioritization of test suites, the involvement of stakeholders such as Chris, Robert, and the Swiss knives team, and the need to establish a hierarchy for test migration and execution.
	Establishing Test Priorities: Giuseppe inquired about the relative importance of different tests, and Roger V. indicated that some prioritization is necessary, suggesting that Chris and Robert could help determine which tests are most critical.
	Role of Swiss Knives Team: Giuseppe noted that the Swiss knives team would collaborate to define priorities and select which tests to migrate and execute, with Robert Weeding acting as an ambassador for the process.
	Incremental Migration Approach: Roger V. recommended starting with one suite of tests and gradually expanding, rather than attempting a comprehensive migration all at once, allowing experts to decide on the exact tests to prioritize.
	Giuseppe’s Current Role and Learning Curve: Giuseppe shared that he is still acclimating to the process and managing priorities, as he is currently splitting his time between roles and learning about the test migration workflow.
Testing Strategy and Standard vs. Client-Specific Tests: 
Giuseppe and Roger V. clarified the distinction between standard and client-specific tests, agreeing that standard tests should be prioritized for automation and client-specific tests minimized, with a formalized testing strategy in development.
	Standard vs. Client-Specific Test Allocation: Giuseppe proposed that tests applicable to standard configurations should be included in the standard testing suite, while only truly client-specific tests should be allocated to customer environments.
	Test Data Agnosticism: Roger V. explained that the test data used is installation-agnostic, allowing standard tests to be reused in client-specific scenarios if needed, though this has not been widely adopted by clients.
	Synchronization Across Environments: Roger V. described efforts to synchronize and align test frameworks and data between Simcorp One and client environments, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.
	Development of Testing Strategy: Giuseppe mentioned that a formal testing strategy is being developed to define processes for adapting, running, and assigning responsibilities for tests within the new framework.
Test Suite Quality, Redundancy, and Future Expansion: 
Giuseppe and Roger V. discussed the quality and structure of the test suites, confirming the absence of redundancies and outlining the principle of developing automated tests for every new configuration, with ongoing expansion as needed.
	Redundancy in Test Suites: Giuseppe questioned whether there was any redundancy in the test suites, and Roger V. confirmed that the tests are well-structured with no unnecessary duplication.
	Principle of Automated Test Development: Roger V. stated that their principle is to never develop new features or configurations without corresponding automated tests, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimal manual testing.
Engagement with Swiss Knives and Other Stakeholders: 
Giuseppe and Roger V. reviewed their engagement history with the Swiss knives team and other stakeholders, noting that direct contact is just beginning and that previous collaboration focused on raising awareness of testing needs during the Simcorp One migration.
	Initial Contact with Swiss Knives: Roger V. clarified that this meeting was the first direct touch point with the Swiss knives team, with previous engagement primarily involving other stakeholders such as John Cunningham, Martin Berling Poulsen, and Julia Falcon.
	Stakeholder Collaboration During Migration: Roger V. recounted that during the migration to Simcorp One, he and Thomas Petuska raised concerns about testing and collaborated with various stakeholders to ensure testing remained a focus.
Follow-up tasks:
Test Prioritization and Selection: 
Coordinate with Chris and Robert to identify and prioritize which automated tests should be onboarded first into the Simcorp 1 framework. (Giuseppe)
Testing Collaboration with Swiss Knives: 
Initiate contact and collaborate with the Swiss Knives team to clarify responsibilities, boundaries, and the process for adapting and running tests in Simcorp 1. (Giuseppe)
Engagement with Thomas Petuska: 
Connect with Thomas Petuska to discuss test onboarding and share experiences regarding migration and automated testing needs. (Giuseppe)
