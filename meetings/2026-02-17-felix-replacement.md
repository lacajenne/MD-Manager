Meeting with Mathias Hecht

- [*][SK] Connect with Mathias about onboarding Henrik - check that he is correctly assigned to the team (with Bettina) and that he is ready to work from March 1st
    - We need to confirm that the replacement is only temporary -- then talk to Bettina and figure out how to handle it in Workday 
    - both Felix and Henrik must have their data correct in Workday

Felix is coming back on July - the replacement is temporary - the contract with the Swiss Knives is renewed every three months
    - if cVation stays with us, Felix will come back

Henrik is very special 
    he made CDMS 1.0 with a team - he is the best possible replacement for Felix
        no one in cVation is as fitting as he is 

We do not know what might happen to him when Felix returns
    depends on the approved head count
        we might have to decide whom to choose 



NEXT STEPS

We need to revive credentials and account revived for Henrik 
    - Monika Macko
    - Iuliia Volkogon
    - Aleksandra (maybe)

I need to become his manager 

Handle in Workday 

Mathias can handle his partial onboarding 

Henrik will help on moving from doing client releases to doing releases of SimCorp One
