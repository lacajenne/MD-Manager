Hi Giuseppe! 
 
I am at the meeting now regarding Trade capture 
it looks like our autotest is quite limited in that area
I wanted to ask if you can prioritize this for Swiss Knife team 
we have to many people contributing to this component that's why we have huge problem with deployment 

Tomek Czapliński and Tomasz Pastuszka can give you more input on requirements for test automation for 
Trade Capture
