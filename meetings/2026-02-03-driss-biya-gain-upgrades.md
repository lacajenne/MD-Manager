discussion with Driss

get in touch with flo and go back to Driss with answers

GAIN is being upgraded in downstram systems running also SCD 

services get killed without warning, tests fail and work is disrupted

AT LEAST communicate upgrades in advance - at least one week
	
occasionally be able to skip and postpone - not expected to happen often

make upgrades in maintenance windows (few hours long)

possibly use the same maintenance window to upgrade GAIN and SCD

organize a meeting if necessary
