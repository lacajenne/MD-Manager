discussion with Driss

get in touch with Flo and go back to Driss with answers

GAIN is being upgraded in downstram systems running also SCD 

services get killed without warning, tests fail and work is disrupted

AT LEAST communicate upgrades in advance - at least one week
	
occasionally be able to skip and postpone - not expected to happen often

make upgrades in maintenance windows (few hours long)

possibly use the same maintenance window to upgrade GAIN and SCD

organize a meeting if necessary

discussion Flo

cloud and support were notified - but it did not reach all the stakeholders

it was maintenance and not upgrade - it should be visible in Web UI and API

it was not something that occurs regularly

maintenance should be scheduled and announced as soon as possible 
    one week of buffer should be sufficient 
    put focus on whom should be notified
    it is currently not clear who all the stakeholders
        cloud and support should know 

flow of information about patches and bug fixes is an issue
