Varun joined SimCorp two months ago, and was working in banks before.
Manual and automated E2E testing. He was onboarded into many things.
Involved in the definition of a testing strategy for value streams.
Worked with AWS before but not in the Azure cloud. Moving to Azure now. 

Are we not separating tests in levels and types? Hard to believe. 
He proposes a division of types of test by environment: SC1DEV for Unit, SC1TEST for system, integration, E2E...
    extending into the client environments

It seems there is a communication/interaction problem. 
Is Varun creating confusion or is he not fitting in an organization that has communication problems?
Swiss Knives are deeply connected - is this only an advantage or also a limitation? 
Varun seems to know the testing theory. He clearly did his homework. But behind this?
