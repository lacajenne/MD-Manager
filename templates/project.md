# Project: Dashboard Redesign

**Status**: In Progress  
**Owner**: Sarah Chen  
**Start Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Target Date**: 2026-01-15

## Objective
Redesign the admin dashboard to improve usability, performance, and maintainability. Replace legacy jQuery code with modern React components.

## Success Criteria
How will we know we've succeeded?
- Page load time reduced by 50% (from 4s to 2s)
- User task completion rate increases by 30%
- Code coverage above 80%
- Zero P0/P1 bugs in first 2 weeks post-launch

## Team
- **Lead**: Sarah Chen
- **Contributors**: 
  - Mike Johnson (Frontend)
  - Lisa Park (Design)
  - David Kim (Backend API support)

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Discovery & Design (Nov 1-15) - ✅ Complete
- **Phase 2**: Core Components (Nov 16 - Dec 15) - 🔄 In Progress
- **Phase 3**: Integration & Testing (Dec 16 - Jan 5)
- **Launch**: January 15, 2026

## Key Decisions
- Using React + TypeScript (decided Nov 5)
- Keeping existing API endpoints, no backend changes (decided Nov 8)
- Phased rollout: 10% users, then 50%, then 100% (decided Nov 20)

## Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Backend API changes needed | High | Medium | Early API testing, have backend eng on standby |
| Design delays rollout | Medium | Low | Weekly design reviews, buffer time in schedule |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Automated cross-browser testing |
| User resistance to change | Low | High | Beta program, collect feedback, iterate |
