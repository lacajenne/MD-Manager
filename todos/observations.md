- is what is happening to the Swiss Knives similar to the scenarios involving the Brett guy in "The Phoenix Project"?
    - can we figure out similar measures?

# My manager's observations

# My team's observations
- [Driss Biya] the team is following a Kanban approach rather than Scrum 
- [Driss Biya] the Swiss Knives are enablers, it seems that boundaries might need to be made clearer
