What tasks are coming to the team? From where? Are they in the scope of SK?
Same question about Felix. Is he the only one who can do what he is doing?

[13:30]
Notes from Natalya V.

Felix is going to be replaced
	he has the knowledge to support the configurators
	in case configurator requests keep coming they should be redirected to the CDS team
	ideally he should be replaced by some simcorp internal or someone who is shadowed by a simcorp internal
	
we had apparently a bi-weekly review that was cancelled, between SK and their stakeholders
	we are expected to reiterate again, maybe on a monthly basis

From Aleksandra for Driss

Hi! I just got these messages from Aleksandra - let us discuss it when you are back 
 
 
Hi - I have this question from Tomasz Pastuszka who is one of the stakeholders from PD application areas that are moving into SC1 environments. I need us to prepare an answer to this for tomorrow afternoon:
"Dear All - I am interested in understanding where the whole Test Automation topic is now - perhaps we can discuss this next Tuesday if anyone here can provide an update? I can see teams are getting more and more serious about working in SC1DEV but the engineers/configurators are still not supported with regards to being able to run automatic tests of their work and no update was yet provided on this through general channel as far as I noticed."
this is about a topic related to movement from Standard Platform to SC1 environments. In SP, there were some automated tests running and I am pretty sure that Tina was exploring with SK the possibilities to (re)use them, but I am not sure if this was pursued further, abandoned, evolved... so we need some updates... and - we need to find a way to track these topics somehow (ideally from DevOps)

SimCorp Dimension Academy - something to sign in to - check with Aleksandra

We do not have people for the execution of the Front Office tests.
Apparently Varun was promised to have a team.

VMO Planning priorities
1- Urgent (Unplanned) - up to 2 weeks + requests from LT
2- Un-/Planned activities with deadline or high impact on other teams- up to 4 weeks
3- BAU & Planned - continuous tasks(daily/weekly/monthly activities) + planned without dependencies with middle or lower impact
4- Ideas/Plans with unsolved dependencies,but it is on our radar

Planning notes
We are going soon to onboard a lot of new people on Value Streams teams (30-50).

Driss Biya and Florian Prinz

DMS Value Stream should be responsible for DM Core upgrades in the standard environment. 
26.01 upgrade for SimCorp Dimension will require DM Core to be upgraded too.
Platform people are responsible for deployments.

We want to talk to the DMS Value Stream to see how they are going to manage this in the future.
And see who else should be involved.

Question for Driss.
Hi! I am starting to build a picture in my head about the work of the Swiss Knives. I’d like to get a sense of where the Swiss Knives team stands at the moment: are you already in a normal operational rhythm, or are you still dealing with a higher share of urgent or temporary tasks while moving toward that steady‑state mode?

Salary Review 2026 - Tobias Sheppard

- pay outcomes feel deeply personal to employees - can feel equally challenging for managers

- there are a lot of sources of pressure: fainness, budget, performance data, morale, expectations... 
    and the EU Pay Transparency requirements

- annual salary review is a check point to validate employee compensation, considering performance along with positioning
    within the pay range and against peers

- approach - data driven
- fairness principle - considering location, performance and position in the range (compa-ratio)
- communication
- practicalities 

Learn about Compa Ratio - actual salary / mid range point

High level principles
market alignment - we benchmark with the technology sector but also consider financial services for some roles
competitive positioning - total cash compensation is centered around market median to insure internal equity 
pay fo performance

Chat with Driss.
SimCorp One going into Value Streams.
There are people going to do front office configuration - new people involved in the whole workflow.
Joining back and middle office in value streams - front office probably are not that mature
Ryan started hiring people without being aware - or ignoring - what was aready happening.
He was looking to hire people for front office when SKs are already covering the process E2E.
He hired Varun - but it was not a good fit. A lot of confusion, a lot of time was spent onboarding him. 
There was a strict hiring process and this hiring jumped over it completely - Varun does not have any of the mandatory knowledge.
He is creating chaos and noise right and left inviting a lot of people that are not concerned - an agent of entropy.
We need to stop this noise from the outside. 
If he accepts to fully work as a Swiss Knife, the team is ready to accept him. 

[10:30]
Chat with Dmytro Pavlenko. 10 years experience, with SimCorp since November. Works in Warsaw.
Works in test automation mostly. Seems as skilled and confident as all others.
Sees cVation as Site Reliability Engineers mostly.
He finds the stress levels acceptable, the environment friendly.
They are building a network of contacts and escalation paths appear to exist.
I told him about my approach - that I will observe, that I know that the team is pretty independent already.
I do not wish to change things in a top-down approach. I want to get there together with them, sharing vision and strategy
from the company. The ceremonies we are going to implement are to be discussed within the team, and we want to reach a pragmatic agreement
on whatever workd best.

[09:45]
Varun was hired in VS SC1 as Test Architect. No one knows what he is expected to do. 
He was tasked to create a testing strategy. But there was a draft from the Swiss Knives that was approved by Paul.
Whatever happend with Varun - he has not the knowledge [Driss] - and SKs are already working on it.
We have a conflict. Discuss with Aleksandra. He came and did not find anything to do because there was already a framework 
    - he volunteered for a testing strategy.
There was apparently an issue in communication.
He should be onboarded with the team, brought to the team and let him do what he wants under the umbrella of SK.
Natalia and Driss wanted to talk with Ryan but apparently were not allowed.
Varun seems to have the wrong compentences and aspirations.

[09:30]
Continuing onboarding and testing strategy discussions
Following the topic with Driss and Florian, we have planned a meeting, going to figure out if other people need to be involved

[09:00]
unplanned work - reserving buffers for unplanned work
customer feedback - the cycle does not hand when we hand stuff over - the feedback is a new starting point

Maybe we can define a timeline for these upgrades together. My understanding is that we want

to announce them at least a few days in advance
figure out how long they will take and whether we expect down time


[13:30]
A lot of topics are covered by cVation people in SK.
Swiss Knives were supposed to be temporary but have become a long term thing.
Workload keeps increasing - SKs are working to empower people - but even with this approach, SK need to grow.
The amount of stuff to be tested is also rapidly increasing and might explode suddenly.

Mathias Hecht Alexander
wave 1 - the start - 1 SK to 2 configurators
wave 2 - onboarding of value teams
wave 3 - Standard Platform - 1 SK to 10 configurators
